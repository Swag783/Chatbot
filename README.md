In this project, I have utilised the RASA framework and modified the training and test data to answer customer queries.
In this project, I have basically tried to frame my model on questions regarding tea and beverages.
All the answers in the training of the model are hypothetical.
I have used very less training data on the model, so accuracy might be a constraint.
